        <p>GitHub requires that I put a link, so here it is.</p>
        <p>This GitHub App automatically attempts to build and test code when new commits are pushed. It expects the `CMakeLists.txt` to be in the repository root folder, and a `tests/bin` folder that contains catch2 test executables in the format `test_*`</p>
