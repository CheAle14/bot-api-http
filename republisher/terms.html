        <h1>Republisher Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>
            This website allows specifically authorized people to republish content from their social media accounts to other, specific, social media accounts<br/>
            For example, one could send an Instagram post from one account and re-publish it to another Instagram account <em>and</em> to a TikTok account.<br/>
            The idea is that the destination accounts (where posts are made to) would have wider reach, more followers, etc, and would make it far easier for other users find these posts and the topics/events discussed within
        
            <br/>
            Refer to the following diagram for an overview:<br/>
            <img src="/_/img/republisher.png"><br/>
            There may be multiple accounts on the left (that are feeding or providing information in), but there would only be one destination account per platform.
