                This opinion should justify your reasoning, explaining clearly and logically how you came to make the decisions you did.<br>
                If possible, you should refer to specific wording of the Terms and Conditions, the Conduct Regulations, and any previous applicable cases.<br>
                This needs to be done so that any future Court of Appeals cases can look to this ruling, and your opinion, for understanding, precedent, and consistency.</label><br>
