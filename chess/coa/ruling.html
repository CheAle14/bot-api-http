    <title>Reach Verdict</title>

    <p>As a Justice, you are part of a panel of Justices that are selected to represent the Court of Appeals<br>
    You are expected to deliberate with the other Justices, then finally reach a verdict<br>
    This verdict may typically involve:
    <ul>
        <li>Unanimous - all Justices agree entirely on a way forward</li>
        <li>Majority - most Justices agree, or concur</li>
        <li>Concur - reaching the same conclusion, but with some (or most) different reasons</li>
        <li>Minority - the Justices that disagree with the majority verdict</li>
    </ul>
    Any descision <strong>must</strong> have a majority behind it; that means at least <strong><REPLACAE id='hearing.JudgeRulingMinimum'/></strong> justices must all concur
    </p>
    <p>
        Below are the possible options this Court may come to:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dismiss</strong> - for cases incorrect on a procedural point (eg, plaintiff having no <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_(law)'>standing</a>, Court having no jurisdiction) </li>
            <li><strong>Uphold</strong> - The Tournament Moderator's descision was entirely correct and requires no correction</li>
            <li><strong>Remand</strong> - Make a requirement of some sort (eg, a limit) then send the matter back down to the Moderator for them to take those requirements into account</li>
            <li><strong>Overturn</strong> - Remove the Moderator's descision entirely and the Court issues its own</li>
            <li><strong>Other</strong> - for when the other verdicts dont fit (<strong>you must provide proper explaination</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Please note: You are expected to be able to explain your position, such that it can be written up and released</p>
