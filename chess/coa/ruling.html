    <p>As a Justice, you are part of a panel of Justices that are selected to represent the Court of Appeals<br>
    You are expected to deliberate with the other Justices, then finally reach a verdict<br>
    Each Justice must provide their opinion for the case, or if they entirely agree with the opinion of another Justice, they may "join" that opinion. If you agree with the conclusion, but not necessarily how to reach it, you "concur", but should join it below and submit a separate opinion to the Chief Justice.<br> 
    Any descision <strong>must</strong> have a majority behind it; that means at least <strong><REPLACE id='hearing.judgerulingminimum'/></strong> justices must all concur
    </p>
    <p>
        Below are some example conclusions you may reach:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dismiss</strong> - for cases incorrect on a procedural point (eg, plaintiff having no <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_(law)'>standing</a>, Court having no jurisdiction) </li>
            <li><strong>Uphold</strong> - The Tournament Moderator's descision was entirely correct and requires no correction</li>
            <li><strong>Remand</strong> - Make a requirement of some sort (eg, a limit) then send the matter back down to the Moderator for them to take those requirements into account</li>
            <li><strong>Overturn</strong> - Remove the Moderator's descision entirely and the Court issues its own</li>
            <li><strong>Something else?</strong> - As long as its justified and allowed by the Terms.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Please note: You are expected to be able to explain your position, such that it can be written up and released</p>
