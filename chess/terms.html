                    <br>c) Upholding the original decision
                </li>
                <li>A judgement from a panel can be appealed to be heard <em>en banc</em>, by the whole Court.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whether the Court accepts to hear the appeal is up to the Chief Justice</li>
                        <li>This would be the final appeal, and would be binding</li>
                    </ol>
