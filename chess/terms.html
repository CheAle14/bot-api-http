        <li>Unsportsmanlike conduct and cheating are prohibited

        </li>
        <li><a id='sIa5'></a>If a game is forced to end by lack of time, and neither player resigns, 
            then the game can be ended by any Moderator and decided as follows:<br/>
            For each player, add up the pieces of the opponent that they have took and assign them a score as so:<br/>
            <b>Pawns</b> - 1<br/>
            <b>Bishops & Knights</b> - 3<br/>
            <b>Rooks</b> - 5<br/>

            Whichever player has the highest score shall win<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            If a player objects to a game's ending, then a rematch may occur on the following available session<br/>
            If the petitioner fails to play the rematch, then the original game is final<br/>
            If the opposing player fails to play the rematch, then the game played is forfeit<br/>
            A rematched game is final, a second rematch cannot be performed.<br/>
            A rematch <i>must</i> have a Moderator or Justice overseeing the game to adjudicate the game.<br/>
            Unless exempted by the Moderator adjudicating the game, all rematches must be time limited to 5 minutes each, with a chessclock preferred.
        </li>

                <li>A Moderator or Justice must be present throughout the game.</li>
                <li>Both players must approve and assent to the chessclock being used</li>
                <li>The chessclock must have two timers, one for each player, that counts down. 
                    The chessclock must have an ability to toggle which timer is currently counting down. 
                    The chessclock must also have an ability to pause and restart both timers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The chessclock should have the ability to keep track of moves, though this is not required
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a player's timer reaches zero, then the game is immediately ended with their opponent winning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any FIDE rule of chess that would apply to chessclocks and is not otherwise exempt applies.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            If a game is generally time-limited without use of a chessclock as defined above, the following shall apply:

        <h3>Section II - Leaderboard</h3>
        <li>Any student is freely permitted to join the Leaderboard with an initial score of 100</li>
        <li>A score below 100 is not permitted</li>
        <li>Changes to the score shall be determined by the Elo Rating system, as implemented; changes may also be given by Moderators, subject to overruling or affirmation</li>
        <li>Members will be expected to register games played
            <ol>
                <li><em>Addendum:</em> Members must only register games that were actually played. Any registration of a fictitious game is considered fraudulent as per below</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Attempting to fraudulently gain points will result in point deductions being applied
        <br>On any first violation, the action must be reversed and points returned as though they never happened
        <br>On any second violation, the player's points are to be reduced by half
        <br>On any third violation, the player's points are to be reset to 100
        <br>Any fourth violation results in an immediate four week ban
        <br>Any fifth violation results in a permanent ban
        <br><em>Moderators may use discretion in the application of the above</em></li>
        <li>Deductions automatically apply, with player's score not dropping below 100.
            <ol>
                <li>Members that are not present for three consecutive weeks will have their score reduced by 15 for each week after and including the third missed</li>
                <li>Members that do not play any games for three consecutive weeks will have their score reduced by 5 for each week after and including the third missed</li>
                <li>If a Member has a valid reason for their absence, they may file an appeal to the Court as though the matter were a technical modification made by the Chief Justice</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li>Any Member that has not been present for more than three of the past 6 weeks, and who has played no more than two games within the same frame may be removed from the Leaderboard by the Chief Justice unilaterally
            <br/>After, the Student shall be entered into the Leaderboard as per Act 1 and 2 of Section II
            <br/>This Act may be used on any banned Member should the conditions be met. Under these circumstances, the Student is forbidden to rejoin until the ban is revoked
        </li>
        <li>Any Member may request in writing (or email or Discord) to the Chief Justice that they be removed from the Leaderboard; the Chief Justice must comply with this request within seven (7) days
            <ol>
                <li>If the Member is banned, or there is currently a Court hearing involving them, then the Chief Justice must not comply until such circumstance has passed</li>
                <li>Removing a Member does not affect their status as Moderator or Justice, only their ability to be counted in games.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A Member may be banned from the Leaderboard by any independent Moderator for repeated violations, or for a serious misconduct, or for actions that bring this Leaderboard or her players into disrepute
            <ol>
                <li>Bans must have a valid reason</li>
                <li>Bans must have an expiry date, which must fall on a Friday</li>
                <li>Bans can be petitioned to the Court, which may elect to shorten or lengthen the ban, or remove it in its entirety</li>
                <li>Only the Court of Appeals may remove or shorten, or lengthen a ban</li>
                <li>After one appeal, the Court may refuse to hear any further Appeals for specified finite duration</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A Member may set to monitored by any Moderator
            <ol>
                <li>Monitors can only be placed if the Moderator has reasonable suspicion that a violation of the Terms had occurred, or could occur</li>
                <li>Monitor may be removed by any Moderator if there is no longer reasonable suspicion to support it being in place</li>
                <li>When monitored, any games played by a Member must be overseen (either partially, or in entirety) by a Moderator</li>
                <li>When monitored, any game added involving the Member must be approved as valid by the previous, or any, Moderator</li>
                <li>If a monitor is not removed after the session immediately following it being put in place, 
                    the Member may petition the Court in an appeal against the Moderator to remove it immediately.<br/>
                    Under these circumstances, the Moderator must give forth their reasonable suspicion, and why it <em>still</em> applies
                </li>
                <li>The Member may petition the Court that the Moderator's suspicion is not reasonable, and thus the Monitor is not permissible under these Terms</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Under situations where a Member repeatedly overruns time, or lengthens games such that other Members are unable to play further games, 
            the Chief Justice may require that Member to use a chessclock in any game they play.
            <ol>
                <li>This action would, for that Member only, render Section I Act 7.2 null</li>
                <li>The Chief Justice has full discretion to determine when this action must or may be taken</li>
                <li>This action cannot be petitioned to the Court, and may be applied and removed only by the Chief Justice</li>
                <li>Immediately upon this coming into force, Amir M will be required to use a chessclock in all games. The time limit is to be determined by Amir M, but can be overruled by the Chief Justice.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Under any circumstances where the above Acts indicate action must, shall, will or is to be taken with no alternative or discretion, 
            the Chief Justice may unilaterally take action in accordance to those Acts.
            <ol>
                <li>Any such action should be documented as soon as possible</li>
                <li>If the actions taken are not supported by Acts in these Terms, the Court of Appeals may hear the petition</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

                    <br>c) Upholding the original decision

                <li>A judgement from a panel can be appealed to be heard <em>en banc</em>, by the whole Court.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whether the Court accepts to hear the appeal is up to the Chief Justice</li>
                        <li>This would be the final appeal, and would be binding</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Within seven (7) days of the Court reaching a verdict, the Court must present its majority opinion in the form of a written document explaining the reasoning as to why the Court came to its decision.
