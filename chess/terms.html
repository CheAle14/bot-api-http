        Except in FIDE 4.2: Adjusting a piece requires no verbal communication so long as it is clear, but must be performed during your turn<br/>
        Except in relation to a chessclock, which is not required.<br/>
        Except in relation to any FIDE rule that would violate the principle of casual play, placing an unnecessary burden on players<br/>
        Except in relation to any FIDE rule that would contradict, either implicitly or explicitly, any Act in these Terms</li>
        <li>Unsportsmanlike conduct and cheating are prohibited

        <li>
            Any student is encouraged to attend, either to spectate or to play.
        </li>
        <li><a id='sIa5'></a>If a game is forced to end by lack of time, and neither player resigns, 
            then the game can be ended by any Moderator and decided as follows:<br/>
            For each player, add up the pieces of the opponent that they have took and assign them a score as so:<br/>
            <b>Pawns</b> - 1<br/>
            <b>Bishops & Knights</b> - 3<br/>
            <b>Rooks</b> - 5<br/>

            Whichever player has the highest score shall win<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            If a player objects to a game's ending, then a rematch may occur on the following available session<br/>
            If the petitioner fails to play the rematch, then the original game is final<br/>
            If the opposing player fails to play the rematch, then the game played is forfeit<br/>
            A rematched game is final, a second rematch cannot be performed.<br/>
            A rematch <i>must</i> have a Moderator or Justice overseeing the game to adjudicate the game.<br/>
            Unless exempted by the Moderator adjudicating the game, all rematches must be time limited to 5 minutes each, with a chessclock preferred.
        </li>
        <li>

            <ol>
                <li>A Moderator or Justice must be present throughout the game.</li>
                <li>Both players must approve and assent to the chessclock being used</li>
                <li>The chessclock must have two timers, one for each player, that counts down. 
                    The chessclock must have an ability to toggle which timer is currently counting down. 
                    The chessclock must also have an ability to pause and restart both timers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The chessclock should have the ability to keep track of moves, though this is not required
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a player's timer reaches zero, then the game is immediately ended with their opponent winning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any FIDE rule of chess that would apply to chessclocks and is not otherwise exempt applies.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            If a game is generally time-limited without use of a chessclock as defined above, the following shall apply:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A Moderator or Justice must be informed of the time limit; when the game begins; any pauses throughout the game; when the game should end.

            <ol>
                <li><em>Addendum:</em> Members must only register games that were actually played. Any registration of a fictitious game is considered fraudulent as per below</li>

        <br><em>Moderators may use discretion in the application of the above</em></li>
        <li>No show policy: Members that are not present for three consecutive weeks will have their score reduced by 40 for each week until reset to 100</li>
        <li>Any Member that has not been present for more than three of the past 6 weeks, and who has played no more than two games within the same frame may be removed from the Leaderboard by the Chief Justice unilaterally
            <br/>After, the Student shall be entered into the Leaderboard as per Act 1 and 2 of Section II
            <br/>This Act may be used on any banned Member should the conditions be met. Under these circumstances, the Student is forbidden to rejoin until the ban is revoked
        </li>
        <li>Any Member may request directly to the Chief Justice that they be removed from the Leaderboard; the Chief Justice must comply with this request within seven (7) days
            <ol>
                <li>If the Member is banned, or there is currently a Court hearing involving them, then the Chief Justice must not comply until such circumstance has passed</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A Member may be banned from the Leaderboard by any independent Moderator for repeated violations, or for a serious misconduct, or for actions that bring this Leaderboard or her players into disrepute
            <ol>
                <li>Bans must have a valid reason</li>
                <li>Bans must have an expiry date, which must fall on a Friday</li>

        <li>A Member may set to monitored by any Moderator
            <ol>
                <li>Monitors can only be placed if the Moderator has reasonable suspicion that a violation of the Terms had occurred, or could occur</li>

                <li>When monitored, any game added involving the Member must be approved as valid by the previous, or any, Moderator</li>
                <li>If a monitor is not removed after the session immediately following it being put in place, 
                    the Member may petition the Court in an appeal against the Moderator to remove it immediately.<br/>
                    Under these circumstances, the Moderator must give forth their reasonable suspicion, and why it <em>still</em> applies
                </li>
                <li>The Member may petition the Court that the Moderator's suspicion is not reasonable, and thus the Monitor is not permissible under these Terms</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Under any circumstances where the above Acts indicate action must, shall, will or is to be taken with no alternative or discretion, 
            the Chief Justice may unilaterally take action in accordance to those Acts.
            <ol>
                <li>Any such action should be documented as soon as possible</li>
                <li>If the actions taken are not supported by Acts in these Terms, the Court of Appeals may hear the petition</li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Within seven (7) days of an individual exercising Moderator powers, such individual <strong>must</strong> publicly declare what action was taken, who it was against, and the reasoning for it
                <ol>
                    <li>For the purposes of this Act, a declaration is public if either:
                        <br/>a) It was sent via email to all the Moderators, Justices, Chief Justice and the accused
                        <br/>b) It was sent via Discord, in the #discussion channel.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>Failure to provide proper reasoning either in this declaration or after, as determined under appeal, may cause grounds to invalidate the penalty, either in severity, or in entirety</li>

            </ol>
        </li>

            The Court of Appeals (CoA) hears matters on appeal from resolutions issued by the aforementioned moderators, or any other matters concerning the Leaderboard
            <ol>
                <li>The staff of the CoA currently are:
                <ul>
                    <uli>Chief Justice Alex C</uli>
                    <REPLACE id='justices'/>
                </ul></li>
                <li>The Court of Appeals should hear cases in panels of three justices, with a majority for a judgement; except for when the Chief Justice is exercising discretionary powers: then they act in Solo</li>
                <li>Justices may exercise Moderator power if needed.</li>
                <li>Moderators shall not act in games they took part of; Justices shall not hear cases they have a conflict in
                    <ol>
                        <li>If there are not enough Justices to be empanelled because of a conflict, then their conflict may be ignored and them selected anyway</li>
                        <li>Conflict only applies to the Chief Justice in order to prevent them from sitting on a panel for a case.</li>
                        <li>Conflict does not apply to an en banc hearing - every Justice must hear the case.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Whether the Court of Appeals hears a case is granted either by the Chief Justice, or at least independent two justices</li>
                <li>The panel of justices to hear a case is selected by the Chief Justice</li>
                <li>The panel may make one of three decisions: 
                    <br>a) Remanding the decision back down to the Moderator, requiring that they re-evaluate with conditions 
                    <br>b) Overturn and making their own decision in its place
                    <br>c) Upholding the original decision
                </li>
                <li>A judgement from a panel can be appealed to be heard <em>en banc</em>, by the whole Court.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whether the Court accepts to hear the appeal is up to the Chief Justice</li>
                        <li>This would be the final appeal, and would be binding</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Within seven (7) days of the Court reaching a verdict, the Court must present its majority opinion in the form of a written document explaining the reasoning as to why the Court came to its decision. The Chief Justice may provide formatting assistance, and, if they are in the majority, may choose who shall write up the Court's verdict.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Any authority not explicitly granted may be exercised unilaterally by the Chief Justice</li>
        <li>The Chief Justice may make technical modifications to the Leaderboard if reasonably necessary, subject to challenge by an <em>en banc</em> hearing
            <!-- This Act is mentioned specifically by Number at /coa/newappeal.html - any changes to order should be reflected there -->
            <ol>
                <li>Any technical modification must be publicly announced </li>

        <h3>Section IV - Modification to these Terms</h3>
        <li>These Terms may be unilaterally changed by the Chief Justice at any times</li>
        <li>It is the responsibility of each Member to keep up-to-date with the Terms, ignorance of these Terms is not considered a valid defence</li>
        <li>Members may suggest changes to the Terms if they desire</li>
        <li>Moderators and Justices are entitled to <a href='https://github.com/CheAle14/bot-api-http/blob/master/chess/terms.html'>submit pull requests to these Terms</a>, though their acceptance is not guaranteed</li>
