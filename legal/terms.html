        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            These Terms of Service ("Terms"), which include the Privacy Policy at https://mlapi.cheale14.com/privacy ("Privacy Policy"),
            are a legal agreement between this website, it's owner, ("MLAPI", "us", "our", "we") and you ("you", "your").  
            By using or accessing the website located at https://mlapi.cheale14.com (the "Site"), or any program provided by the Site (including, but not limited to, the Chess program), or the MLAPI bot (Discord id of 432861863437402113), which are collectively referred to as the "Service", you agree:
            <ol>
                <li>that you are 13 years of age, and the minimum age of digital consent in your country</li>
                <li>if you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction or over, that you have read understood and accept to be bound by the Terms</li>
                <li>if you are between 13 (or the age of digital consent, as applicable) and the age of majority, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms</li>
            </ol>            
        </p>
        <p>
            MLAPI reserves the right to update these Terms, which we may do for reasons that include, but are not limited to, complying with changes to the law or reflecting enhancements to MLAPI.
            If the changes affect your usage of MLAPI or your legal rights, we will make best efforts to notify you no less than seven days before the changes take effect.
            Unless we state otherwise, your continued use of the Service after we post modifications will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to those changes.
            If you object to the changes, your recourse shall be to cease using the Service.
